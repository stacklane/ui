# Shared UI Components

## Guidelines

- Avoid hover effects as much as possible (not mobile friendly).
- Don't use the hand for general UI actions. Reserve it for actual HTTP links.
  - Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines: the hand cursor should be used when “the content is a URL link”.
  - W3C User Interface guidelines: "The cursor is a pointer that indicates a link”.
  - Microsoft: Displaying the hand pointer on hover is the definitive indication of a link.
    To avoid confusion, it is imperative not to use the hand pointer for other purposes.
